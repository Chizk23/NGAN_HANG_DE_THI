## üåü Project Overview

This project was developed to address a real-world need in the education sector: the necessity for a specialized, powerful, and user-friendly tool to digitize and manage question banks. The system helps minimize manual labor, automates processes, and provides intelligent features to enhance work efficiency.

Our platform is designed to serve the workflow of teachers and training managers:

*   **For Educators/Content Creators:** We provide an intuitive interface to create, categorize, and store questions. Advanced search and filtering tools make it easy to find and reuse content.
*   **For Administrators:** The system allows for the flexible creation and customization of exams from the existing question bank, which can then be exported into professional file formats for printing or online use.

To effectively connect these processes, we have integrated modern technologies such as **Artificial Intelligence (Google Gemini)** to automatically extract questions from images, speeding up the data entry and document digitization process.

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   **JDK 11** or newer
*   **Apache Maven** 3.6+
*   **MySQL Server** 8.0+
*   An IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
*   **Google Gemini API Key**

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Chizk23/NGAN_HANG_DE_THI.git
    cd NGAN_HANG_DE_THI
    ```
2.  **Set up the Database**
    *   Open the `src/main/resources/config.properties` file and update the `db.user` and `db.password` for MySQL.
    *   Create the database in MySQL:
        ```sql
        CREATE DATABASE NGAN_HANG_DE_THI CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
        ```
    *   **For the first run:** Uncomment the line `DatabaseManager.initializeSchemaAndDatabase();` in the `MainApplication.java` file and run the application to automatically create the tables. Then, comment it out again.

3.  **Set up the API Key**
    *   Open the `src/main/resources/config.properties` file and add your API Key:
        ```properties
        ai.gemini.apikey=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY_HERE
        ```

4.  **Build and Run the Application**
